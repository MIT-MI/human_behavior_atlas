# 🧠 Human Behavior Atlas

Official repository for **Human Behavior Atlas (HBA)**, a large-scale benchmark for unified psychological and social behavior understanding.

Human Behavior Atlas provides a comprehensive evaluation framework spanning diverse behavioral domains, including emotion recognition, sentiment understanding, humor and sarcasm detection, intent recognition, non-verbal communication, and mental health indicators. The benchmark is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of **socially intelligent AI systems** capable of grounded behavioral reasoning across multimodal inputs.

## 🤖 Models

The OmniSapiens-7B RL model, trained using GRPO on the Human Behavior Atlas benchmark, is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ddvd233/OmniSapiens-7B-RL)

OmniSapiens-7B RL is the first iteration of a unified multimodal behavioral model for social reasoning and behavioral understanding across diverse behavioral domains.
